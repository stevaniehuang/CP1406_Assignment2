<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>

<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> <ul>
	<li>Results is amazing and exceeds our expectations.</li>
	<li>We split the works properly, effectively and efficently.</li>
	<li>Members expresses ideas well so that the design and content were made collaboratively. Each member group listened to each other's opinions</li>
	<li>Communication went well. Members did work directly when one needs the progress to advance and always inform to each other constantly if any progress happens.</li>
	<li>We helped each other in any issues we are facing on. We took over one's task if the member cannot do it or finish it.</li>
	<li>We trusted each other well. The work progressed smoothly.</li>

 </p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> <ul> 
	<li>Some disagreements (in content and styling) happened in teamwork process.</li>
	<li>Laziness spread to each other in the group. If one member is not working, the other one follows.</li>
	<li>Group members had some other works therefore group member cannot prioritize the progress on time.</li>
	<li>Certain individual is being dominant.</li>
	<li>Each members are too dependent to each other. We did not check each others error until last minute.</li>

<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> (including significant lessons) ...</p>
