<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>

<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> <ul>
	<li>The result was great to us and exceeds our expectations.</li>
	<li>We split the work properly, effectively and efficently.</li>
	<li>Members expressed their ideas well so that the design and content were made collaboratively. Each group member listened to the other's opinions.</li>
	<li>Communication went well. We took turns doing our work in stages as there were parts which required the other member's work and always informed each other when we did it to keep them updated. </li>
	<li>We helped each other in any issues we are facing on. We took over a task if the other member cannot do it or finish it.</li>
	<li>We trusted each other well. The work progressed smoothly and we also checked each other's works and correct any little mistakes.</li></ul>

 </p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> <ul> 
	<li>Some disagreements (in content and styling) happened in teamwork process.</li>
	<li>Laziness spread to each other in the group. If one member is not working, the other one follows.</li>
	<li>Group members had some other work therefore this was not prioritized well.</li>
	<li>There were times when one was too dominant.</li>
	<li>Members are too trustworthy of each other. We did not check each other's error until last minute.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> (including significant lessons) <ul>
	<li>Javascript is not that hard to understand.</li>
	<li>Aesthetic design is extremely important to the success of a website.</li>
	<li>Creating site from scratch needs a lot of work, but it is fun as we get know to all of our codes.</li>
	<li>Working in group makes work much easier and improvement can always happen.</li>
</ul></p>
